  ## Description 

This budget tracking app is a PWA (progressive web application) that allows the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget whether or not they have an internet connection. The user can enter transactions while offline and their offline entries will populate once they are online again.

This app is built using a Mongo database using Mongo Atlas, with IndexedDB on the front end. The routes are handled using Express. This app is deployed to Heroku.
